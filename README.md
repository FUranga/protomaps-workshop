# protomaps-workshop

This code was developed as companion material for my [2025 Hands-on online mapping course](https://journalismcourses.org/product/hands-on-mapmaking-for-journalism-2025-edition/) with the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas at the University of Texas at Austin, June 2 to 29, 2025.

## Tools used for the class

We will use the free features of these services you should sign up for before the class begins. I encourage you to play with these services a little, too, if you have time:

- [Datawrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/signin), a charting and mapping tool. You can create an account with your email or use your existing Github, Google or Microsoft accounts.
- [Github](https://github.com/), a place to store — and use — computer code. We'll use this to provide you with your own copy of the class code and to operate your own "computer in a cloud," with a service Github calls "Codespaces."
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), one of many cloud storage services that allow you to put files on the internet for anyone to view. This is where we'll put our public map files.

We'll also use [Mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org), a free, powerful tool made by Matthew Bloch of the New York Times (no signup necessary).

And we'll use [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com), another free and powerful tool, made by Brandon Liu. Protomaps lets you make interactive, zoomable maps without the need of a mapping service (no signup necessary).
